                <p>
                The Last of Us Part II takes place five years after the events of the first game and 
                about 25 years after the outbreak of the Cordyceps Brain Infection began. Ellie, who is 
                now 19 years old, returns as the main protagonist whom players assume control of, as well 
                as Joel in his mid-fifties.[5] The story will be split into four seasonal chapters, starting 
                with Jackson County, Wyoming, during the winter months. The pair, having settled down in Tommy's 
                settlement, live in relative peace within the thriving community. While there, Ellie has even managed 
                to form friendships with Dina and Jesse. However, the survivors face constant threats from the Infected 
                and other hostile survivors.
                </p>
                <p>
                When a tragic event disrupts the tranquility of her life, Ellie embarks on a journey in a search for vengeance 
                to carry out justice. As she hunts down those responsible one 
                by one, she is confronted with the traumatizing physical and emotional consequences of her actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                Ellie is fueled by hate, which is a major theme within the story.[7] The game will also 
                primarily be set in Seattle, Washington.

                Ellie was originally intended to be the sole playable character in the game's singleplayer 
                campaign.[12] However, this changed at some point before release, with Joel, Ellie, and Abby 
                all being playable for portions of the game. While multiplayer was originally planned to launch 
                with the game,[13] it was revealed by Lead Game Designer Emilia Schatz that the game will not 
                feature multiplayer, a statement later confirmed by a representative for Sony.
                </p>
                <p>
                The game features expanded traversal and stealth mechanics, including a jump button, ability to go 
                prone and a dodge mechanic. Enemy AI has been improved, notably how human enemies will often communicate 
                with each other, relaying information about Ellie's position through whistling. Crafting has also been 
                expanded, along with new ammo types (such as explosive arrows). Two noteworthy additions are an 
                "identification meter", which, in addition to the audio cue from the first game, alerts the player 
                to how close an enemy is to seeing them (while it's white, the player still has the opportunity to 
                hide, but once it turns red, they have been spotted), and an "injury gauge", which indicates when 
                the player receives a serious wound (such as an arrow to the shoulder) and must press and hold the 
                R1 button in order to treat it. Another new addition is the ability to pick up glass bottles and/or 
                bricks, and throw them, while running.
                </p>
                <p>
                The game also features new enemy types as well. It contains two new Infected types. The first is 
                the Shambler type that emits acidic spores similar to Bloaters except these are also exhibited 
                immediately after death. Further, there is also a special unique boss Infected that is fought 
                while playing as Abby. Further, there are also a new human enemy type that resemble the Brute 
                enemies encountered in the Uncharted series, another game series created by Naughty Dog.

                In February 2014, creative director Neil Druckmann said the possibility of a sequel to the 
                The Last of Us was "about 50/50", and the team needed to develop a story "really worth telling, 
                and that's not repeating itself".[16] In July 2014, community strategist Arne Meyer said that not 
                considering a sequel "would be a disservice" to the studio and the fans.

                In December 2014, character artist Michael Knowland who previously worked with 
                Naughty Dog on The Last of Us updated his LinkedIn page to include The Last of Us 2 
                with him as the lead character artist who was designing head sculpts. Shortly afterwards 
                his page was updated to remove all mention of the sequel.

                At MetroCon 2015 in June, Nolan North, who portrays David in The Last of Us and 
                Nathan Drake in the Uncharted series, was asked if he was involved in any future 
                Naughty Dog projects. He replied "For now, Uncharted 4 is the last one. I know 
                they're doing The Last of Us 2, but my character in The Last of Us kind of met an 
                untimely demise".[19] Druckmann later responded to North's comments, saying that a 
                small team at Naughty Dog had explored ideas and begun building prototypes for a sequel, 
                but were interrupted when the team shifted their focus to development of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.

                Rumors briefly rose again after an Easter egg referring to The Last of Us appeared in 
                Uncharted 4's denouement specifically a picture of a pregnant woman resembling Ellie with 
                the title The Last of Us: American Daughters next to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                Rumors peaked once more when GameInformer accidentally leaked images and information 
                regarding a sequel to The Last of Us at E3 2016, specifically that Ellie would be 19 
                years old and that the story would transition between the present and the past.[22] An 
                image was also revealed on September 26, depicting a tattooed arm holding a switchblade, 
                evidently teasing the reveal of Ellie's tattoo.[23] Another poster was also released on 
                the same day in 2017, this time depicting an arm holding a hammer amidst flames that resemble 
                the face of a wolf.[24] A third poster was released by Naughty Dog to celebrate outbreak day in 
                2018, the image displaying a man playing an acoustic guitar in the woods with a wolf next to him.

              The Last of Us Part II released to universal acclaim among critics worldwide. 
              Many praised the game for its visuals, gameplay, and story. GameSpot's Kallie 
              Plagge remarked the game's combat was "intense and exhilarating", liking how the 
              game maintained the freedom from the first game for players to choose between stealth 
              or gunplay during combat, though did criticize that the level's sizes were too expansive, 
              especially since collectibles available in such areas did not match the size of the level 
              design. They concluded the game's duration of more than twenty hours could have been considerably shorter.
              </p>
              <p>
              Chris Carter from Destructoid wrote praise regarding the actors, especially 
              Ashley Johnson's performance as Ellie, and the game's environments, believing the 
              Naughty Dog developers brought the game's setting to life in a way that surpasses the 
              previous installment. In fact, they declare it the best looking game on the PlayStation 4 console. 
              However, they would have liked if the game did differ more from the first one, remarking "Part II is 
              essentially the same wheel from the first game", simply polished over. Still, Carter concludes 
              "Part II improves on what it's predecessor did in 2013."[59] Euro Gamer's Oli Walsh agreed Johnson 
              was the stand out performance but especially praised Gustavo Santaolalla's score for the game, 
              believing the music was "excellent" in conjunction with its "minimalism"
              </p>
              <p>
              However, some were critical that the game failed to evolve much from its predecessor. 
              Maddy Myers from Polygon remarked that Part II failed to live up to the first game, citing the 
              character's lack of growth and the dull story that felt overly bloated and long, citing the game's 
              critical problem was its poor pacing and failure to justify its own existence as a sequel.[61] Koji 
              Fukuyama from IGN agrees, saying they also found the amount of combat encounters "excessive", 
              believing the developers failed to strike the balance between combat, story and exploration that 
              the first game excelled at.[57] In fact, Myers believed the game's combat additions with dog enemies, 
              new infected types and ability to go prone was a "half-hearted" effort to hide that the game was 
              little more than the first game with new coat of paint. They expanded that, while it was still a 
              strong game, the industry had evolved in the seven years since the first game's release so were 
              expecting more from this sequel, rather than simply more of the same. Regardless, they still thought 
              the game was aesthetically "gorgeous" and would have received higher praise if it wasn't so 
              similar to The Last of Us, which Myers believed the superior game.
              </p>
              <p>
              IGN's Jonathan Dornbush contested such claims, believing the gameplay was a "satisfying evolution" 
              from the first game with a "profound story" that justified it's creation. They go as far to say 
              "The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and 
              rich world design of the original in nearly every way."[56] Andy McNamara from Game Informer agreed, 
              writing that Part II was "the best narrative game [they] ever played", highlighting the complex 
              story and compelling characters.
              </p>
              <p>
              The game sold 4 million copies in its first three days, setting a new franchise record.
