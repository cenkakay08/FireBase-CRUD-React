                <b>Fantasy VII Remake</b> is a remake of Final Fantasy VII, originally released for the PlayStation in 
                1997. The game is entirely remade, using the story and characters from the original, and will be 
                released in parts. Each game in the project will have a volume of content comparable to a standalone 
                Final Fantasy game. The disc version of the first game is a two-Blu-ray Disc set. The official title
                is Final Fantasy VII Remake to convey its status as a remake rather than a spin-off or sequel.
                The Remake is a reimagining of the original game that goes deeper into the world and characters.
                The game is being developed by Square Enix's Business Division 1, helmed by Yoshinori Kitase as 
                producer (the original director of Final Fantasy VII) and Tetsuya Nomura as director 
                (original character designer known as the director for Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and the 
                Kingdom Hearts series).
            </p>
            <p>
                The remake was a surprise announcement made on June 15 during E3 2015, after years of rumors and fan 
                demand. The debut gameplay trailer was shown on December 5, 2015 during PlayStation Experience 2015.
                The first part of the project was set to be released worldwide on March 3, 2020, but the release date was 
                pushed back to April 10. The first part covers the events of Midgar from the original game. The game Is 
                100GB in size. A playable demo of the game was released for PlayStation 4 on March 2, 2020, one day 
                before the title's originally scheduled release date. On March 30, 2020, it was revealed that the game 
                had been shipped early to some consumers in Europe and Australia to counter any potential disruptions 
                related to the COVID-19 pandemic of the time. Producer Yoshinori Kitase and director Tetsuya Nomura 
                implored those who received the game early to not spoil the game for fans.

                <h3>Battle System</h3>
                <p>
                    Combat in Final Fantasy VII Remake is in real-time, with the player being able to switch between 
                    party members on-the-fly and use a wide range of abilities and spells. The player can issue orders 
                    to the other characters, or leave them to AI. Switching to a different party member is encouraged, 
                    however, in order to make best use of their unique abilities, as the AI will mostly play defensively 
                    and will not use abilities and magic on their own. In addition, enemies will often favor attacking 
                    the player-controlled character, which makes switching between characters optimal to avoid being 
                    overwhelmed by opponents. The materia system can be used to tailor one's playstyle and abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During battle, the player can press the X button to bring up the in-battle menu, called "Tactical 
                    Mode", where time slows down drastically, allowing the player to assess their current situation plan 
                    their next move, such as using magic or items. Players can also use the L2 and R2 buttons to issue 
                    specific commands to the non-active characters (the ones that are not being controlled).
                    Players can block incoming enemy attacks by pressing and holding the R1 button, which reduces the 
                    damage taken by 40%; players can move while blocking, but at greatly decreased speed. Not all enemy 
                    attacks can be blocked, however. It is also possible perform dodge rolls as evasive maneuvers using 
                    the Circle and the analog stick to roll into the desired direction; this action does not grant any 
                    form of invincibility frames.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To aim for a new take on the classic concepts that the original Final Fantasy VII is known for, the
                    development team revamped the ATB system with an evolution of that which yields a fast action paced 
                    experience, yet retains tactical control. Characters can now be moved freely during battles and can 
                    use basic attacks (Square) and unique skills (Triangle) to deal damage to their opponents. Each 
                    character have their own ATB bar, that once filled allows them to use abilities, spells and items.
                    In standard modes (Easy, Normal, Hard), the ATB Gauge fills up slowly by itself and by repeatedly 
                    attacking, but in Classic Mode this aspect is handled automatically, where characters will 
                    automatically basic attack enemies, allowing the player to focus solely on selecting commands, 
                    similar to the original release. Classic Mode is activated from the difficulty menu. It is 
                    possible to revert to direct control at any time during Classic Mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Characters can unleash powerful moves that deal a lot of damage to their opponents, called 
                    limit breaks. Each character has their own limit gauge, which fills as they take damage 
                    (and when they stagger opponents), and once filled, the characters can use their special attacks,
                    which can be used at any given time during battle and consume no ATB. However, unlike in the 
                    original game, players cannot "store" their limits after battle to use on the next; the gauge will
                    reset at the end of every battle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A new system introduced in Final Fantasy VII Remake compared to the original is the stagger 
                    mechanic, where attacking an opponent will fill up a gauge that once filled will leave them in a 
                    vulnerable state where they take increased damage. Staggering enemies is a core part of the 
                    gameplay in the remake, encouraging players to exploit it through abilities and elemental 
                    vulnerabilities.
                </p>
                <h3>Abilities and weapon upgrades</h3>
                <p>
                    Each character has their own set of abilities, divided in two: signature abilities 
                    (which they start with) and weapon abilities (which are attached to specific weapons 
                    the characters can equip). Using abilities requires to use ATB, and unlike magic, they 
                    do not consume MP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ability has a proficiency value that improves as the ability is used. 
                    When this proficiency is maxed out, the wielder learns it permanently and it can be 
                    used with any weapon. Additionally, upon leveling up, the character earns Skill Points 
                    (SP), which can be spent in the Weapon Upgrade Menu to enhance the weapon, ranging from 
                    granting stat bonuses to adding more Materia slots.
                </p>
                <h3>Materia system</h3>
                <p>
                    Much like in the original game, players use materia to customize their characters and 
                    tailor their playstyle. Materia are obtained in various ways, some being found while 
                    exploring while others can only be purchased at shops. The player can partake in a specific 
                    sidequest chain with Chadley to obtain unique materia that cannot be found elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are five types of materia:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Magic Materia Magic Materia:</b> used to grant magic spells, which require ATB and MP to be 
                    cast, such as Cure Cure, Fire Fire and Thunder Thunder. It also includes materia that grant 
                    status effects.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Command Materia Command Materia: </b>used to grant abilities that require ATB to be used, such as Assess, 
                    Steal and Enemy Skill.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Support Materia Support Materia: </b>link with other materia to enhance the materia they are 
                    linked to, provided that the player has a weapon or armor with linked slots. Examples include 
                    Magnify Materia Magnify Materia (which when linked with magic materia causes the spells to affect 
                    all allies or enemies) and Elemental Materia Elemental Materia (which imbues the weapon or armor 
                    with the elemental properties of the magic materia attached to it).
                    <br/>
                    <b>Complete Materia Complete Materia: </b>grant passive effects to the wielder, such as HP Up, 
                    MP Up and Luck Up.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Summoning Materia Summoning Materia: </b>special materia that have a dedicated slot in the 
                    character's weapon, and only one can be equipped at said character at any given time. 
                    Summoning materia require specific conditions to be used. Once the conditions have been met, 
                    and the character has enough ATB, the summon can be activated, where a creature will appear and 
                    fight alongside the player until the timer expires, and the summon exits by performing its 
                    signature attack. The vast majority of summoning materia are obtained by completing VR missions 
                    with Chadley.

                <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                <hr class="wikiHR"/>
                <h3>Setting</h3>
                <p>
                  Gaia is a technologically advanced planet dominated by humans, who are the only major sentient 
                  race other than a few nearly extinct species. The world is economically, militarily, 
                  and politically dominated by the powerful conglomerate of Shinra Electric Power Company, 
                  which profits from the use of mako reactors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reactors siphon a special type of energy—called mako—out of the planet and convert it into 
                  electricity, giving consumers access to technological comforts and innovations that ease and 
                  improve the quality of everyday life. One of the byproducts of the extraction and refinement of 
                  Mako energy is materia, a concentrated form of mako which allows the wielder to harness its 
                  magical properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  President Shinra leads his eponymous organization, and is the world's de facto ruler. 
                  Unbeknown to most of the world, Shinra's existence hides many atrocities and acts of 
                  despotism committed since its rise to power, including public manipulation and internal 
                  scandal, in addition to abuses of its authority, from morally questionable scientific 
                  experimentation, human rights abuses, unaddressed civil inequalities and unrest, military 
                  and police-scale oppression, as well as repeated denial of any detrimental effects resulting 
                  from the use of mako as a source of energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mako energy is drawn from the lifestream, a flow of life-force beneath the planet's surface. 
                  All life originates from the lifestream, and returns to it upon death, and the lifestream is 
                  the sum of all the life that has ever and will ever live upon the planet. The process of 
                  extracting Mako energy drains the life of the planet to generate electricity. This can be 
                  seen in the Shinra's capital city of Midgar surrounded by a wasteland where plants barely grow.
                </p>

                <h1>Music</h1>
                <hr class="wikiHR"/>
                <p>
                  The game will feature arranged and updated remixes of songs heard in the original game, 
                  as well as several new tracks. Background music will transition to a 
                  battle variation in certain areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In June 2019, it was revealed Nobuo Uematsu will return for the remake, though in what capacity 
                  was not stated in full at the time. It was then revealed in January 31, 2020 that the game's 
                  ending theme, "Hollow", was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and sung by Yosh from Survive Said The Prophet.
                   The lyrics are by Kazushige Nojima, translated by Ben Sabin and John Crow. It was also revealed that 
                   Masashi Hamauzu and Mitsuto Suzuki were composing and arranging music for the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The music featured in the E3 2015 reveal trailer was "Beyond The Wasteland" from Advent Children as 
                  well as part of the Distant Worlds orchestrated rendition of "Opening - Bombing Mission", which was 
                  further used in the gameplay trailer shown at PlayStation Experience 2015.
                </p>

              <h1>Release</h1>
              <hr class="wikiHR"/>
              <p>
                The game is planned for release in multiple parts, as a remake of Final Fantasy VII would not fit into 
                a single release. Was the team to dedicate to a single release, the content would need to be cut, 
                so rather than remake the game as a full volume, it was decided to do it in parts. The parts will be 
                full-sized games with the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy cited as the base model, each part being the scale 
                of one game from the XIII series. The first installment was released on two Blu-ray discs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game is set to be released for the PlayStation 5 on June 10, 2021 under the title 
                Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, with updated graphics and a side story revolving around 
                Yuffie Kisaragi working with a branch of Avalanche.
