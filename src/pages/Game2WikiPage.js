            Persona 5 is the sixth game in the Persona series. It is a role-playing game developed by Atlus' P-Studio. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Persona 5 is a fantasy based on reality which follows a group of troubled high school students: 
            the protagonist and a collection of compatriots he meets along the way. These disturbed and troubled 
            teenagers gradually realize that they are living in a toxic and dangerous world resembling a prison full 
            of slavery, oppression and injustice, ruled by corrupted and twisted adults. They can't live with the 
            system and can't live without it, and simply existing means they are at risk of being doomed and condemned 
            to a life of slavery. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In order to seek freedom, liberation and justice, they live dual lives as rebellious Phantom 
            Thieves of Hearts. Using a mysterious smartphone app, they undertake fantastical adventures by 
            using otherworldly powers to enter the hearts of people (specifically, corrupt adults in positions 
            of power) in order to re-shape and transform them. The Phantom Thieves realize that society forces people 
            to wear masks to protect their inner vulnerabilities, and by confronting their inner selves and by 
            literally ripping off their protective mask do the heroes awaken their inner power, using it to help 
            those in need. Ultimately, the group of Phantom Thieves seeks to change their day-to-day world to match 
            their perception, end slavery and see through the masks modern society wears.

            Persona 5 Royal, alternatively known as P5R and called Persona 5: The Royal in Japan, is an
             enhanced rerelease of Persona 5 exclusively for the PlayStation 4, but can be played on the 
             PlayStation 5 due to backwards compatibility.

                     the same time as the protagonist. She is a great admirer of the protagonist and one of
                      the few people in school who treats him kindly. Though not an official Phantom Thief at
                       first, she briefly assists the protagonist during the events of the original game. She 
                       wears a black mask with silver accents and wields rapiers and rifles in battle.
                  </li>

                  Takuto Maruki: A part-time school counselor and researcher of cognitive psience 
                  who enters Shujin Academy following Kamoshida's arrest. He is a genuine, understanding 
                  person and always helps students whenever needed, being among one of the more popular members 
                  of the school faculty. He is one of the protagonist's new Confidants in the story.

                  Jose: A mysterious young boy who researches humans and helps the Phantom Thieves in Mementos. 
                  Flowers and star stamps can be collected in Mementos, and the protagonist can trade these items
                   with Jose in his shop: flowers are traded for items, and star stamps allow him to change Mementos'
                    cognition, improving the rate at which rewards are given, such as experience, money and items. He 
                    can also turn Will Seeds into more powerful accessories with unique skills that greatly aid in battle.

                <p>
                While the Phantom Thieves begin to form, the protagonist will acquaint with more faces: 
                Kasumi Yoshizawa, a newly enrolled first-year scholarship student in Shujin Academy and a 
                talented gymnast; and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired to help the students after 
                Kamoshida turns himself into the police. During the Phantom Thieves' first exploration in Mementos, 
                they also meet a mysterious entity in the form of a boy known as Jose. Aside of giving vital services 
                in Mementos, he also grants the protagonist a Wishing Star capable of letting party members perform 
                Showtimes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                On October 3rd, the protagonist, Morgana, and Kasumi find themselves in an unknown Palace 
                linked to the construction site of a stadium in Odaiba Seaside Park. There, Kasumi finds a 
                cognitive version of her deceased sister, who is quickly squashed by a tall, lanky and disturbing 
                looking Shadow that bursts into a Byakhee. Kasumi's frustration at the school administration pushing 
                their desires onto her, along with grief over the death of her younger sister, causes her to awaken to
                her Persona, Cendrillon, and team up with the protagonist and Morgana to defeat the Shadow. After they 
                escape the Palace, Morgana invites Kasumi to join the Phantom Thieves, an invitation she declines, 
                believing she would be doing a disservice to the group to join when she isn't fully invested in their 
                work. If the calling card to Kunikazu Okumura was sent on October 2nd, these events will instead be 
                pushed back to the 4th, allowing for the heist of Okumura's Palace to take place on the 3rd. 
                </p>
                <p>
                On November 19th, Kasumi will appear briefly in Niijima's Palace, helping the protagonist escape 
                from the authorities by assisting him with defeating a large group of Shadows pursuing him. 
                She reaffirms the promise he made to her that he would return safely, before quickly taking her 
                leave to distract the rest of the Shadows on his tail. 
                </p>
                <p>
                If Maruki's Confidant was completed prior to November 18th, after the Phantom Thieves defeat 
                Yaldabaoth on Christmas Eve, while Sae Niijima requests the protagonist help her prosecute 
                Masayoshi Shido by turning himself into the police, instead Goro Akechi will suddenly reappear 
                and offer to testify in his place. The protagonist and Morgana both return to Leblanc and celebrate
                 Christmas Day and New Year's Eve with the Phantom Thieves. Because of Akechi's testimonies, the woman
                  whom Shido harassed at the start of the year was found, and Shido was arrested for treason. However,
                   before New Year, the protagonist dreams of himself walking around school and hearing his friends 
                   talking about their desires, with a garbled voice over the intercom expressing disappointment at 
                   the protagonist's desire to leave. 
                </p>
                <p>
                On January 1, while the protagonist prepares for a shrine visit with Kasumi, abnormalities began to 
                surface, starting from an unknown teenager sitting on one of LeBlanc's chairs, followed by Futaba 
                mentioning her mother buying her a yukata. When he meets Ryuji, Ann, Makoto, Yusuke, Futaba and Haru 
                at the Meiji Shrine, he is shocked by Haru mentioning going to lunch with her father, Futaba planning 
                to go shopping with her mother, Makoto spending time with her "family," and Ann meeting with with Shiho. 
                When all of the protagonist's friends depart but Kasumi, Shinichi Yoshizawa arrives to tell Kasumi that 
                all of her relatives are at home. In doing so, he calls her by her given name, which provokes a strange 
                reaction on the protagonist, not being able to process the use of the name. 
                </p>
                <p>
                On January 2, the protagonist witnesses the abnormalities first hand, learning that the unknown 
                teenager he met in Leblanc the previous morning is actually Morgana, now a human, and finding Wakaba 
                Isshiki celebrating New Year with Sojiro and Futaba, followed by Akechi, seemingly released from jail, 
                visiting to discuss the abnormalities with him, having found it suspicious that he was suddenly 
                acquitted of his charges. After a phone call from Kasumi about the mysterious Palace they previously 
                visited in Odaiba, the three investigate and discover that Maruki is the Palace's ruler. 
                </p>
                <p>
                He confesses to the trio that he had made everyone's desires into reality. In addition, the real 
                Kasumi is dead, and the "Kasumi" the protagonist has come to know is her twin sister, Sumire Yoshizawa.
                 Through counseling, Maruki had subconsciously caused Sumire to believe that she was Kasumi in order to
                  help her cope with Kasumi's death, as was her wish. After seizing her from the boys due to her desire
                   to be re-established as Kasumi, he urges the protagonist to see what his new reality looks like
                    before deciding whether he wants to live in it for himself by January 9. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Throughout the week, the protagonist visits the other Phantom Thieves individually and tries to 
                remind them of their former lives. He also witnesses firsthand that Kunikazu Okumura and Makoto's 
                father are no longer deceased, Ryuji's leg was never broken and he reconciled with his track teammates, 
                Shiho will be transferring back to Shujin for reasons other than Kamoshida's abuse and Madarame was an 
                ideal mentor to Yusuke instead of treating him as a source of profit. After he meets all seven teammates, 
                Akechi calls the protagonist about what he found relating Maruki, and tells him that neither Wakaba, 
                Okumura and Makoto's father were dead to begin with in this reality because Maruki tampered with history 
                instead of outright reviving the dead as cognitive beings.

                <h3>Daily Life</h3>
                <p>
                The story takes place over the course of a year, and the protagonist must 
                balance high school life and reforming society.
                </p>
                <p>
                The protagonist lives in the attic of Café Leblanc and can explore various locations 
                in the Greater Tokyo Area using the subway system. He can take taking part-time jobs, 
                play video games, go out with friends, go to restaurants, study, go to the movies, play baseball, 
                go to the bathhouse, fish, exercise in their own home or go to the gym, make equipment for use in 
                battle, messages, watch DVDs or go to the clinic. A certain amount of these activities can increase 
                the protagonist's stat performance such as their Max HP and SP. There are also a variety of minigames. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Using the P. A. D., the SNS system allows the protagonist to chat with other people using phone 
                text messages, helping them learn more about their personalities and background. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The Confidant system is similar to the Social Links of Persona 3 and Persona 4 
                and involves building relationships with helpers around the city for various benefits in 
                Palaces as well as battle. 
                </p>
                <h3>Dungeons</h3>
                <p>
                The Palace of every arc of the main storyline has a certain deadline to complete. Failure to 
                complete the Palace before the deadline will result in a "false ending" Game Over scene where the 
                protagonist misremembers why he was arrested, and is assassinated by a mysterious figure, when Sae 
                leaves him alone to remember the truth. It is impossible to explore past dungeons once they're cleared, 
                so it is recommended to do so in advance as much as possible. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Unlike dungeons in previous entries in the series, a majority of Palaces include fixed design, 
                and are not randomly generated. They feature unique elements of platforming (jumping up and down ledges), 
                puzzles, stealth, and traps. 
                </p>
                <p>
                A dungeon called Mementos is where the party can traverse by driving a vehicle transformed 
                from Morgana where they can collect treasures, obtain Personas that are present in the previously 
                collapsed Palaces and complete requests to steal the hearts of minor targets submitted to the Phantom 
                Aficionado Website (Phan-site for short). Mementos is affected by the weather, and it is a good idea to 
                explore Mementos during days with bad weather for advantages in battle. The dungeon is randomly generated. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Battle can be initiated when the protagonist is in stealth mode and ambushes the enemy, which 
                gives the party a preemptive turn. If the protagonist fails in stealth, the security level will increase. 
                A spotlight will then follow him, which causes the enemies to pursue him persistently. After victory in a 
                battle, the spotlight will stop chasing the protagonist. If the protagonist successfully performs another 
                ambush attack, the security level will drop slightly. When the security level reaches 100%, the party is 
                forced to leave the dungeon for the day. The next time the party enters the same dungeon again, the 
                security level will drop by a portion. Mementos does not have a security level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                After the party successfully makes it to the end of a Palace, they can go back to the real world 
                and send a calling card to their target. Doing so takes the entire daytime period away and during 
                that night they cannot go outside Café Leblanc, although they can still craft tools if that ability 
                is unlocked. During the next day, they will be automatically thrown into the Palace and cannot get 
                out until the boss at the end is defeated. Afterwards, the Palace will collapse the Palace and advance 
                the story further. 
                </p>
                <h3>Combat</h3>
                <p>
                The party engages in strategic turn-based combat with Shadows and bosses using both melee and ranged 
                weapons, instead of only one type of weapon. The party will use their Personas in battle to combat 
                Shadows. The general aim is to find the enemy's weakness and exploit it in order to knock them down. 
                </p>
                <p>
                If the protagonist dies in battle, the game will end. However, if it was a boss battle, 
                it is possible to restart the battle before the boss. Death in a random battle will start the 
                game back at the most recent Safe Room. Protecting the protagonist is an important priority. 
                </p>
                <p>
                When a party member has knocked down an enemy, a new ability called "Baton Pass" appears, where 
                the party member can pass their "1 More" turn to another combatant to boost up their attack and 
                healing power during that turn, which goes higher if the streak is kept going. The maximum is 
                three passes, as the "baton" cannot be passed to the same party member twice. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Unlike traditional RPGs, where the player has to go through layers of menus in order to give a 
                command in battle, Persona 5 features an improved UI which offers shortcuts to major commands 
                like melee attack, gun attack, Persona skills, items, guard and tactical order. Instead of navigating
                 a wheel in Persona 3 or a vertical list in Persona 4, choices are now a button press away, allowing 
                 for fast-paced action. The party can also gain access to the ability to switch party members during 
                 battle, although these are Confidant abilities only attainable from Hifumi Togo and/or Futaba Sakura. 
                </p>

              <h1>Development</h1>
              <hr class="wikiHR"/>
              <p>
              Persona 5 was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the 
              Persona series. Notable staff members, such as Katsura Hashino, Shigenori Soejima and Shoji Meguro returned.
              </p>
              <p>
              Development began in a preparatory phase in 2008, following the release of Persona 4.[7] 
              Only after the release of Catherine in 2011, which was used as a "test" for the next Persona game, 
              did full development begin. Albeit they used a third-party engine for Catherine, by its release they 
              have developed their own internal engine, which they would use for Persona 5.[8][9] When deciding on 
              what devices and consoles to publish the game, it was discussed internally to move the series to mobile 
              gaming devices like the PlayStation Vita or smartphones. Eventually, Hashino and his team chose the 
              PlayStation 3 as they felt that fans would love to see another game for home consoles. 
              </p>
              <p>
              The game was first mentioned to be in development in August 2011 in an interview with Katsura Hashino, 
              the producer of the Persona series. Hashino confirmed that the basic preparations for the development 
              were finished and announced the return of Shigenori Soejima and Shoji Meguro as character designer and 
              music composer, respectively. Both Soejima and Meguro previously worked together with Hashino on 
              Persona 3, Persona 4 and Catherine. Hashino originally had the concept of "backpacking and flying 
              all over the world" as a frame for the theme of self-discovery, but after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake 
              and tsunami occurred, the change of the mood of people around him made him decide to change his direction. 
              Instead, he wanted to "connect the adventurous spirit in people's hearts" with something like an "inner
