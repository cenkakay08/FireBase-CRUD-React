PlayStation in \r\n                1997. The game is entirely remade, using the story and characters from the original, and will be \r\n                released in parts. Each game in the project will have a volume of content comparable to a standalone \r\n                Final Fantasy game. The disc version of the first game is a two-Blu-ray Disc set. The official title\r\n                is Final Fantasy VII Remake to convey its status as a remake rather than a spin-off or sequel.\r\n                The Remake is a reimagining of the original game that goes deeper into the world and characters.\r\n                The game is being developed by Square Enix's Business Division 1, helmed by Yoshinori Kitase as \r\n                producer (the original director of Final Fantasy VII) and Tetsuya Nomura as director \r\n                (original character designer known as the director for Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and the \r\n                Kingdom Hearts series).\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The remake was a surprise announcement made on June 15 during E3 2015, after years of rumors and fan \r\n                demand. The debut gameplay trailer was shown on December 5, 2015 during PlayStation Experience 2015.\r\n                The first part of the project was set to be released worldwide on March 3, 2020, but the release date was \r\n                pushed back to April 10. The first part covers the events of Midgar from the original game. The game Is \r\n                100GB in size. A playable demo of the game was released for PlayStation 4 on March 2, 2020, one day \r\n                before the title's originally scheduled release date. On March 30, 2020, it was revealed that the game \r\n                had been shipped early to some consumers in Europe and Australia to counter any potential disruptions \r\n                related to the COVID-19 pandemic of the time. Producer Yoshinori Kitase and director Tetsuya Nomura \r\n                implored those who received the game early to not spoil the game for fans.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <h1>GamePlay</h1>\r\n                <hr class=\"wikiHR\"/>\r\n                <h3>Battle System</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Combat in Final Fantasy VII Remake is in real-time, with the player being able to switch between \r\n                    party members on-the-fly and use a wide range of abilities and spells. The player can issue orders \r\n                    to the other characters, or leave them to AI. Switching to a different party member is encouraged, \r\n                    however, in order to make best use of their unique abilities, as the AI will mostly play defensively \r\n                    and will not use abilities and magic on their own. In addition, enemies will often favor attacking \r\n                    the player-controlled character, which makes switching between characters optimal to avoid being \r\n                    overwhelmed by opponents. The materia system can be used to tailor one's playstyle and abilities.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    During battle, the player can press the X button to bring up the in-battle menu, called \"Tactical \r\n                    Mode\", where time slows down drastically, allowing the player to assess their current situation plan \r\n                    their next move, such as using magic or items. Players can also use the L2 and R2 buttons to issue \r\n                    specific commands to the non-active characters (the ones that are not being controlled).\r\n                    Players can block incoming enemy attacks by pressing and holding the R1 button, which reduces the \r\n                    damage taken by 40%; players can move while blocking, but at greatly decreased speed. Not all enemy \r\n                    attacks can be blocked, however. It is also possible perform dodge rolls as evasive maneuvers using \r\n                    the Circle and the analog stick to roll into the desired direction; this action does not grant any \r\n                    form of invincibility frames.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    To aim for a new take on the classic concepts that the original Final Fantasy VII is known for, the\r\n                    development team revamped the ATB system with an evolution of that which yields a fast action paced \r\n                    experience, yet retains tactical control. Characters can now be moved freely during battles and can \r\n                    use basic attacks (Square) and unique skills (Triangle) to deal damage to their opponents. Each \r\n                    character have their own ATB bar, that once filled allows them to use abilities, spells and items.\r\n                    In standard modes (Easy, Normal, Hard), the ATB Gauge fills up slowly by itself and by repeatedly \r\n                    attacking, but in Classic Mode this aspect is handled automatically, where characters will \r\n                    automatically basic attack enemies, allowing the player to focus solely on selecting commands, \r\n                    similar to the original release. Classic Mode is activated from the difficulty menu. It is \r\n                    possible to revert to direct control at any time during Classic Mode.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Characters can unleash powerful moves that deal a lot of damage to their opponents, called \r\n                    limit breaks. Each character has their own limit gauge, which fills as they take damage \r\n                    (and when they stagger opponents), and once filled, the characters can use their special attacks,\r\n                    which can be used at any given time during battle and consume no ATB. However, unlike in the \r\n                    original game, players cannot \"store\" their limits after battle to use on the next; the gauge will\r\n                    reset at the end of every battle.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    A new system introduced in Final Fantasy VII Remake compared to the original is the stagger \r\n                    mechanic, where attacking an opponent will fill up a gauge that once filled will leave them in a \r\n                    vulnerable state where they take increased damage. Staggering enemies is a core part of the \r\n                    gameplay in the remake, encouraging players to exploit it through abilities and elemental \r\n                    vulnerabilities.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Abilities and weapon upgrades</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Each character has their own set of abilities, divided in two: signature abilities \r\n                    (which they start with) and weapon abilities (which are attached to specific weapons \r\n                    the characters can equip). Using abilities requires to use ATB, and unlike magic, they \r\n                    do not consume MP.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    ability has a proficiency value that improves as the ability is used. \r\n                    When this proficiency is maxed out, the wielder learns it permanently and it can be \r\n                    used with any weapon. Additionally, upon leveling up, the character earns Skill Points \r\n                    (SP), which can be spent in the Weapon Upgrade Menu to enhance the weapon, ranging from \r\n                    granting stat bonuses to adding more Materia slots.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Materia system</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Much like in the original game, players use materia to customize their characters and \r\n                    tailor their playstyle. Materia are obtained in various ways, some being found while \r\n                    exploring while others can only be purchased at shops. The player can partake in a specific \r\n                    sidequest chain with Chadley to obtain unique materia that cannot be found elsewhere.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    There are five types of materia:\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    <b>Magic Materia Magic Materia:</b> used to grant magic spells, which require ATB and MP to be \r\n                    cast, such as Cure Cure, Fire Fire and Thunder Thunder.

The world is economically, militarily, \r\n                  and politically dominated by the powerful conglomerate of Shinra Electric Power Company, \r\n                  which profits from the use of mako reactors.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  The reactors siphon a special type of energy—called mako—out of the planet and convert it into \r\n                  electricity, giving consumers access to technological comforts and innovations that ease and \r\n                  improve the quality of everyday life. One of the byproducts of the extraction and refinement of \r\n                  Mako energy is materia, a concentrated form of mako which allows the wielder to harness its \r\n                  magical properties.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  President Shinra leads his eponymous organization, and is the world's de facto ruler. \r\n                  Unbeknown to most of the world, Shinra's existence hides many atrocities and acts of \r\n                  despotism committed since its rise to power, including public manipulation and internal \r\n                  scandal, in addition to abuses of its authority, from morally questionable scientific \r\n                  experimentation, human rights abuses, unaddressed civil inequalities and unrest, military \r\n                  and police-scale oppression, as well as repeated denial of any detrimental effects resulting \r\n                  from the use of mako as a source of energy.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  Mako energy is drawn from the lifestream, a flow of life-force beneath the planet's surface. \r\n                  All life originates from the lifestream, and returns to it upon death, and the lifestream is \r\n                  the sum of all the life that has ever and will ever live upon the planet. The process of \r\n                  extracting Mako energy drains the life of the planet to generate electricity.

During the Phantom Thieves' first exploration in Mementos, \r\n                they also meet a mysterious entity in the form of a boy known as Jose. Aside of giving vital services \r\n                in Mementos, he also grants the protagonist a Wishing Star capable of letting party members perform \r\n                Showtimes. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                On October 3rd, the protagonist, Morgana, and Kasumi find themselves in an unknown Palace \r\n                linked to the construction site of a stadium in Odaiba Seaside Park. There, Kasumi finds a \r\n                cognitive version of her deceased sister, who is quickly squashed by a tall, lanky and disturbing \r\n                looking Shadow that bursts into a Byakhee. Kasumi's frustration at the school administration pushing \r\n                their desires onto her, along with grief over the death of her younger sister, causes her to awaken to\r\n                her Persona, Cendrillon, and team up with the protagonist and Morgana to defeat the Shadow. After they \r\n                escape the Palace, Morgana invites Kasumi to join the Phantom Thieves, an invitation she declines, \r\n                believing she would be doing a disservice to the group to join when she isn't fully invested in their \r\n                work. If the calling card to Kunikazu Okumura was sent on October 2nd, these events will instead be \r\n                pushed back to the 4th, allowing for the heist of Okumura's Palace to take place on the 3rd. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                On November 19th, Kasumi will appear briefly in Niijima's Palace, helping the protagonist escape \r\n                from the authorities by assisting him with defeating a large group of Shadows pursuing him. \r\n                She reaffirms the promise he made to her that he would return safely, before quickly taking her \r\n                leave to distract the rest of the Shadows on his tail. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                If Maruki's Confidant was completed prior to November 18th, after the Phantom Thieves defeat \r\n                Yaldabaoth on Christmas Eve, while Sae Niijima requests the protagonist help her prosecute \r\n                Masayoshi Shido by turning himself into the police, instead Goro Akechi will suddenly reappear \r\n                and offer to testify in his place. The protagonist and Morgana both return to Leblanc and celebrate\r\n                 Christmas Day and New Year's Eve with the Phantom Thieves. Because of Akechi's testimonies, the woman\r\n                  whom Shido harassed at the start of the year was found, and Shido was arrested for treason. However,\r\n                   before New Year, the protagonist dreams of himself walking around school and hearing his friends \r\n                   talking about their desires, with a garbled voice over the intercom expressing disappointment at \r\n                   the protagonist's desire to leave. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                On January 1, while the protagonist prepares for a shrine visit with Kasumi, abnormalities began to \r\n                surface, starting from an unknown teenager sitting on one of LeBlanc's chairs, followed by Futaba \r\n                mentioning her mother buying her a yukata. When he meets Ryuji, Ann, Makoto, Yusuke, Futaba and Haru \r\n                at the Meiji Shrine, he is shocked by Haru mentioning going to lunch with her father, Futaba planning \r\n                to go shopping with her mother, Makoto spending time with her \"family,\" and Ann meeting with with Shiho. \r\n                When all of the protagonist's friends depart but Kasumi, Shinichi Yoshizawa arrives to tell Kasumi that \r\n                all of her relatives are at home. In doing so, he calls her by her given name, which provokes a strange \r\n                reaction on the protagonist, not being able to process the use of the name. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                On January 2, the protagonist witnesses the abnormalities first hand, learning that the unknown \r\n                teenager he met in Leblanc the previous morning is actually Morgana, now a human, and finding Wakaba \r\n                Isshiki celebrating New Year with Sojiro and Futaba, followed by Akechi, seemingly released from jail, \r\n                visiting to discuss the abnormalities with him, having found it suspicious that he was suddenly \r\n                acquitted of his charges. After a phone call from Kasumi about the mysterious Palace they previously \r\n                visited in Odaiba, the three investigate and discover that Maruki is the Palace's ruler. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                He confesses to the trio that he had made everyone's desires into reality. In addition, the real \r\n                Kasumi is dead, and the \"Kasumi\" the protagonist has come to know is her twin sister, Sumire Yoshizawa.\r\n                 Through counseling, Maruki had subconsciously caused Sumire to believe that she was Kasumi in order to\r\n                  help her cope with Kasumi's death, as was her wish. After seizing her from the boys due to her desire\r\n                   to be re-established as Kasumi, he urges the protagonist to see what his new reality looks like\r\n                    before deciding whether he wants to live in it for himself by January 9. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Throughout the week, the protagonist visits the other Phantom Thieves individually and tries to \r\n                remind them of their former lives. He also witnesses firsthand that Kunikazu Okumura and Makoto's \r\n                father are no longer deceased, Ryuji's leg was never broken and he reconciled with his track teammates, \r\n                Shiho will be transferring back to Shujin for reasons other than Kamoshida's abuse and Madarame was an \r\n                ideal mentor to Yusuke instead of treating him as a source of profit. After he meets all seven teammates, \r\n                Akechi calls the protagonist about what he found relating Maruki, and tells him that neither Wakaba, \r\n                Okumura and Makoto's father were dead to begin with in this reality because Maruki tampered with history \r\n                instead of outright reviving the dead as cognitive beings. \r\n                </p>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <br/>\r\n                <h1>GamePlay</h1>\r\n                <hr class=\"wikiHR\"/>\r\n                <h3>Daily Life</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The story takes place over the course of a year, and the protagonist must \r\n                balance high school life and reforming society.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The protagonist lives in the attic of Café Leblanc and can explore various locations \r\n                in the Greater Tokyo Area using the subway system. He can take taking part-time jobs, \r\n                play video games, go out with friends, go to restaurants, study, go to the movies, play baseball, \r\n                go to the bathhouse, fish, exercise in their own home or go to the gym, make equipment for use in \r\n                battle, messages, watch DVDs or go to the clinic. A certain amount of these activities can increase \r\n                the protagonist's stat performance such as their Max HP and SP. There are also a variety of minigames. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Using the P. A. D., the SNS system allows the protagonist to chat with other people using phone \r\n                text messages, helping them learn more about their personalities and background. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The Confidant system is similar to the Social Links of Persona 3 and Persona 4 \r\n                and involves building relationships with helpers around the city for various benefits in \r\n                Palaces as well as battle. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Dungeons</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The Palace of every arc of the main storyline has a certain deadline to complete. Failure to \r\n                complete the Palace before the deadline will result in a \"false ending\" Game Over scene where the \r\n                protagonist misremembers why he was arrested, and is assassinated by a mysterious figure, when Sae \r\n                leaves him alone to remember the truth. It is impossible to explore past dungeons once they're cleared, \r\n                so it is recommended to do so in advance as much as possible. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Unlike dungeons in previous entries in the series, a majority of Palaces include fixed design, \r\n                and are not randomly generated. They feature unique elements of platforming (jumping up and down ledges), \r\n                puzzles, stealth, and traps. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                A dungeon called Mementos is where the party can traverse by driving a vehicle transformed \r\n                from Morgana where they can collect treasures, obtain Personas that are present in the previously \r\n                collapsed Palaces and complete requests to steal the hearts of minor targets submitted to the Phantom \r\n                Aficionado Website (Phan-site for short). Mementos is affected by the weather, and it is a good idea to \r\n                explore Mementos during days with bad weather for advantages in battle. The dungeon is randomly generated. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Battle can be initiated when the protagonist is in stealth mode and ambushes the enemy, which \r\n                gives the party a preemptive turn. If the protagonist fails in stealth, the security level will increase. \r\n                A spotlight will then follow him, which causes the enemies to pursue him persistently. After victory in a \r\n                battle, the spotlight will stop chasing the protagonist. If the protagonist successfully performs another \r\n                ambush attack, the security level will drop slightly. When the security level reaches 100%, the party is \r\n                forced to leave the dungeon for the day. The next time the party enters the same dungeon again, the \r\n                security level will drop by a portion. Mementos does not have a security level. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                After the party successfully makes it to the end of a Palace, they can go back to the real world \r\n                and send a calling card to their target. Doing so takes the entire daytime period away and during \r\n                that night they cannot go outside Café Leblanc, although they can still craft tools if that ability \r\n                is unlocked. During the next day, they will be automatically thrown into the Palace and cannot get \r\n                out until the boss at the end is defeated. Afterwards, the Palace will collapse the Palace and advance \r\n                the story further. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Combat</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The party engages in strategic turn-based combat with Shadows and bosses using both melee and ranged \r\n                weapons, instead of only one type of weapon. The party will use their Personas in battle to combat \r\n                Shadows. The general aim is to find the enemy's weakness and exploit it in order to knock them down. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                If the protagonist dies in battle, the game will end. However, if it was a boss battle, \r\n                it is possible to restart the battle before the boss. Death in a random battle will start the \r\n                game back at the most recent Safe Room. Protecting the protagonist is an important priority. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                When a party member has knocked down an enemy, a new ability called \"Baton Pass\" appears, where \r\n                the party member can pass their \"1 More\" turn to another combatant to boost up their attack and \r\n                healing power during that turn, which goes higher if the streak is kept going. The maximum is \r\n                three passes, as the \"baton\" cannot be passed to the same party member twice. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Unlike traditional RPGs, where the player has to go through layers of menus in order to give a \r\n                command in battle, Persona 5 features an improved UI which offers shortcuts to major commands \r\n                like melee attack, gun attack, Persona skills, items, guard and tactical order. Instead of navigating\r\n                 a wheel in Persona 3 or a vertical list in Persona 4, choices are now a button press away, allowing \r\n                 for fast-paced action. The party can also gain access to the ability to switch party members during \r\n                 battle, although these are Confidant abilities only attainable from Hifumi Togo and/or Futaba Sakura. \r\n                </p>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <h1>Development</h1>\r\n              <hr class=\"wikiHR\"/>\r\n              <p>\r\n              Persona 5 was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the \r\n              Persona series. Notable staff members, such as Katsura Hashino, Shigenori Soejima and Shoji Meguro returned.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n              Development began in a preparatory phase in 2008, following the release of Persona 4.[7] \r\n              Only after the release of Catherine in 2011, which was used as a \"test\" for the next Persona game, \r\n              did full development begin. Albeit they used a third-party engine for Catherine, by its release they \r\n              have developed their own internal engine, which they would use for Persona 5.[8][9] When deciding on \r\n              what devices and consoles to publish the game, it was discussed internally to move the series to mobile \r\n              gaming devices like the PlayStation Vita or smartphones. Eventually, Hashino and his team chose the \r\n              PlayStation 3 as they felt that fans would love to see another game for home consoles. \r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n              The game was first mentioned to be in development in August 2011 in an interview with Katsura Hashino, \r\n              the producer of the Persona series. Hashino confirmed that the basic preparations for the development \r\n              were finished and announced the return of Shigenori Soejima and Shoji Meguro as character designer and \r\n              music composer, respectively. Both Soejima and Meguro previously worked together with Hashino on \r\n              Persona 3, Persona 4 and Catherine. Hashino originally had the concept of \"backpacking and flying \r\n              all over the world\" as a frame for the theme of self-discovery, but after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake \r\n              and tsunami occurred, the change of the mood of people around him made him decide to change his direction. \r\n              Instead, he wanted to \"connect the adventurous spirit in people's hearts\" with something like an \"inner \r\n              revolution.\" Eventually, this led to the \"picaresque juvenile\" theme and took inspiration of the classic \r\n              phantom thief genre.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <h1>External Links</h1>\r\n              <hr class=\"wikiHR\"/>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li><a href=\"https://atlus.com/p5r/\">Official English site</a></li>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_5\">Wikipedia</a></li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n            </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Game1WikiPage;","import '../assets/css/GameWikiPage.css'\r\nimport tlou2 from '../assets/img/tlou2.jpg';\r\n\r\nfunction Game1WikiPage() {\r\n\r\n  return(\r\n    <section id=\"maincontent\">\r\n            <div class=\"container\">\r\n              <div class=\"row\">\r\n                <div class=\"img\">\r\n                    <img src={tlou2} alt=\"The Last of Us 2\" title=\"The Last of Us 2\" />\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class=\"gameTitle\">\r\n                    <h1>The Last of Us 2</h1>\r\n                    <p><b>Developers:</b> Naughty Dog</p>\r\n                    <p><b>Publishers:</b> Sony Interactive Entertainment</p>\r\n                    <p><b>Release Date:</b> 19.06.2020</p>\r\n                    <p><b>Genre:</b> Action-Adventure</p>\r\n                    <p><b>Platform:</b> PS4</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div class=\"gameInfo\">\r\n            <p>\r\n            The Last of Us Part II is a third-person action-adventure, survival horror video game developed by \r\n            Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

Ellie, who is \r\n                now 19 years old, returns as the main protagonist whom players assume control of, as well \r\n                as Joel in his mid-fifties.[5] The story will be split into four seasonal chapters, starting \r\n                with Jackson County, Wyoming, during the winter months. The pair, having settled down in Tommy's \r\n                settlement, live in relative peace within the thriving community. While there, Ellie has even managed \r\n                to form friendships with Dina and Jesse. However, the survivors face constant threats from the Infected \r\n                and other hostile survivors.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                When a tragic event disrupts the tranquility of her life, Ellie embarks on a journey in a search for vengeance \r\n                to carry out justice. As she hunts down those responsible one \r\n                by one, she is confronted with the traumatizing physical and emotional consequences of her actions.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Ellie is fueled by hate, which is a major theme within the story.[7] The game will also \r\n                primarily be set in Seattle, Washington.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Characters</h3>\r\n                <lu>\r\n                  <li>Ellie (Ashley Johnson) – The protagonist of the game.

She sports a tattoo over the bite scar on her \r\n                    right arm to hide her immunity. After witnessing a horrific attack, Ellie embarks on a personal \r\n                    quest for vengeance.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                  <li>Abby (Laura Bailey)[9] – The false protagonist of the game.

Unbeknownst to Ellie, Joel killed the Fireflies who were going to\r\n                     kill Ellie to create a cure.\r\n                     </li>\r\n                  <li>Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) - Tommy is Joel's younger brother and is one of the leaders of the \r\n                    community in Jackson, alongside his wife Maria. Tommy is the only person aware of Joel's \r\n                    killing of the Fireflies and deception of Ellie. Tommy, like Ellie, spends the game on his \r\n                    own quest for vengeance.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                  <li>Dina (Shannon Woodward)[11] - Dina is a close friend and love interest of Ellie and a \r\n                    resident of the community in Jackson.

Lev is branded an apostate by the Serephites for shaving his hair and is \r\n                  hunted by them alongside his older sister, Yara. Lev becomes Abby's companion and assists her.\r\n                  </li>\r\n                  <li>\r\n                  Yara (Victoria Grace)[9] – Yara is Lev's older sister who left the Seraphites with him, and is severely \r\n                  injured by them during their escape. \r\n                  She later accompanies Abby during the flashbacks of the latter's perspective.\r\n                  </li>\r\n                  <li>\r\n                  Isaac (Jeffrey Wright) – Isaac is the leader of the Washington Liberation Front, and a secondary \r\n                  antagonist in Abby's story.\r\n                  </li>\r\n                </lu>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <h1>GamePlay</h1>\r\n                <hr class=\"wikiHR\"/>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Ellie was originally intended to be the sole playable character in the game's singleplayer \r\n                campaign.[12] However, this changed at some point before release, with Joel, Ellie, and Abby \r\n                all being playable for portions of the game. While multiplayer was originally planned to launch \r\n                with the game,[13] it was revealed by Lead Game Designer Emilia Schatz that the game will not \r\n                feature multiplayer, a statement later confirmed by a representative for Sony.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The game features expanded traversal and stealth mechanics, including a jump button, ability to go \r\n                prone and a dodge mechanic. Enemy AI has been improved, notably how human enemies will often communicate \r\n                with each other, relaying information about Ellie's position through whistling. Crafting has also been \r\n                expanded, along with new ammo types (such as explosive arrows). Two noteworthy additions are an \r\n                \"identification meter\", which, in addition to the audio cue from the first game, alerts the player \r\n                to how close an enemy is to seeing them (while it's white, the player still has the opportunity to \r\n                hide, but once it turns red, they have been spotted), and an \"injury gauge\", which indicates when \r\n                the player receives a serious wound (such as an arrow to the shoulder) and must press and hold the \r\n                R1 button in order to treat it. Another new addition is the ability to pick up glass bottles and/or \r\n                bricks, and throw them, while running.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The game also features new enemy types as well. It contains two new Infected types. The first is \r\n                the Shambler type that emits acidic spores similar to Bloaters except these are also exhibited \r\n                immediately after death. Further, there is also a special unique boss Infected that is fought \r\n                while playing as Abby. Further, there are also a new human enemy type that resemble the Brute \r\n                enemies encountered in the Uncharted series, another game series created by Naughty Dog. \r\n                </p>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <br/>\r\n                <h1>Development</h1>\r\n                <hr class=\"wikiHR\"/>\r\n                <p>\r\n                In February 2014, creative director Neil Druckmann said the possibility of a sequel to the \r\n                The Last of Us was \"about 50/50\", and the team needed to develop a story \"really worth telling, \r\n                and that's not repeating itself\".[16] In July 2014, community strategist Arne Meyer said that not \r\n                considering a sequel \"would be a disservice\" to the studio and the fans.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                In December 2014, character artist Michael Knowland who previously worked with \r\n                Naughty Dog on The Last of Us updated his LinkedIn page to include The Last of Us 2 \r\n                with him as the lead character artist who was designing head sculpts. Shortly afterwards \r\n                his page was updated to remove all mention of the sequel.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                At MetroCon 2015 in June, Nolan North, who portrays David in The Last of Us and \r\n                Nathan Drake in the Uncharted series, was asked if he was involved in any future \r\n                Naughty Dog projects. He replied \"For now, Uncharted 4 is the last one. I know \r\n                they're doing The Last of Us 2, but my character in The Last of Us kind of met an \r\n                untimely demise\".[19] Druckmann later responded to North's comments, saying that a \r\n                small team at Naughty Dog had explored ideas and begun building prototypes for a sequel, \r\n                but were interrupted when the team shifted their focus to development of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Rumors briefly rose again after an Easter egg referring to The Last of Us appeared in \r\n                Uncharted 4's denouement specifically a picture of a pregnant woman resembling Ellie with \r\n                the title The Last of Us: American Daughters next to it.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Rumors peaked once more when GameInformer accidentally leaked images and information \r\n                regarding a sequel to The Last of Us at E3 2016, specifically that Ellie would be 19 \r\n                years old and that the story would transition between the present and the past.[22] An \r\n                image was also revealed on September 26, depicting a tattooed arm holding a switchblade, \r\n                evidently teasing the reveal of Ellie's tattoo.[23] Another poster was also released on \r\n                the same day in 2017, this time depicting an arm holding a hammer amidst flames that resemble \r\n                the face of a wolf.[24] A third poster was released by Naughty Dog to celebrate outbreak day in \r\n                2018, the image displaying a man playing an acoustic guitar in the woods with a wolf next to him.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <h1>Release</h1>\r\n              <hr class=\"wikiHR\"/>\r\n              <p>\r\n              The Last of Us Part II released to universal acclaim among critics worldwide. \r\n              Many praised the game for its visuals, gameplay, and story. GameSpot's Kallie \r\n              Plagge remarked the game's combat was \"intense and exhilarating\", liking how the \r\n              game maintained the freedom from the first game for players to choose between stealth \r\n              or gunplay during combat, though did criticize that the level's sizes were too expansive, \r\n              especially since collectibles available in such areas did not match the size of the level \r\n              design. They concluded the game's duration of more than twenty hours could have been considerably shorter.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n              Chris Carter from Destructoid wrote praise regarding the actors, especially \r\n              Ashley Johnson's performance as Ellie, and the game's environments, believing the \r\n              Naughty Dog developers brought the game's setting to life in a way that surpasses the \r\n              previous installment. In fact, they declare it the best looking game on the PlayStation 4 console. \r\n              However, they would have liked if the game did differ more from the first one, remarking \"Part II is \r\n              essentially the same wheel from the first game\", simply polished over. Still, Carter concludes \r\n              \"Part II improves on what it's predecessor did in 2013.\"[59] Euro Gamer's Oli Walsh agreed Johnson \r\n              was the stand out performance but especially praised Gustavo Santaolalla's score for the game, \r\n              believing the music was \"excellent\" in conjunction with its \"minimalism\"\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n              However, some were critical that the game failed to evolve much from its predecessor. \r\n              Maddy Myers from Polygon remarked that Part II failed to live up to the first game, citing the \r\n              character's lack of growth and the dull story that felt overly bloated and long, citing the game's \r\n              critical problem was its poor pacing and failure to justify its own existence as a sequel.[61] Koji \r\n              Fukuyama from IGN agrees, saying they also found the amount of combat encounters \"excessive\", \r\n              believing the developers failed to strike the balance between combat, story and exploration that \r\n              the first game excelled at.[57] In fact, Myers believed the game's combat additions with dog enemies, \r\n              new infected types and ability to go prone was a \"half-hearted\" effort to hide that the game was \r\n              little more than the first game with new coat of paint. They expanded that, while it was still a \r\n              strong game, the industry had evolved in the seven years since the first game's release so were \r\n              expecting more from this sequel, rather than simply more of the same. Regardless, they still thought \r\n              the game was aesthetically \"gorgeous\" and would have received higher praise if it wasn't so \r\n              similar to The Last of Us, which Myers believed the superior game.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n              IGN's Jonathan Dornbush contested such claims, believing the gameplay was a \"satisfying evolution\" \r\n              from the first game with a \"profound story\" that justified it's creation. They go as far to say \r\n              \"The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and \r\n              rich world design of the original in nearly every way.\"[56] Andy McNamara from Game Informer agreed, \r\n              writing that Part II was \"the best narrative game [they] ever played\", highlighting the complex \r\n              story and compelling characters.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n              The game sold 4 million copies in its first three days, setting a new franchise record.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <h1>External Links</h1>\r\n              <hr class=\"wikiHR\"/>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li><a href=\"https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_part_ii\">Official English site</a></li>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II\">Wikipedia</a></li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n            </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Game1WikiPage;","import firebase from \"firebase/app\";\r\nrequire(\"firebase/auth\");\r\nrequire(\"firebase/database\");\r\nrequire(\"firebase/firestore\");\r\n\r\nvar firebaseConfig = {\r\n  apiKey: \"AIzaSyBPbTOZtpNZBemyXNPYcJn0DxMha9zX1F0\",\r\n  authDomain: \"test-games-cd6c1.firebaseapp.com\",\r\n  projectId: \"test-games-cd6c1\",\r\n  storageBucket: \"test-games-cd6c1.appspot.com\",\r\n  messagingSenderId: \"648680393325\",\r\n  appId: \"1:648680393325:web:4f3ccd4cbfb75589334d64\",\r\n  measurementId: \"G-PJ2LGJHF1K\",\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst fire = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\r\n\r\nexport default fire;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nconst Login = (props) => {\r\n  const {\r\n    email,\r\n    setEmail,\r\n    password,\r\n    setPassword,\r\n    handleLogin,\r\n    handleSignup,\r\n    hasAccount,\r\n    setHasAccount,\r\n    emailError,\r\n    passwordError,\r\n  } = props;\r\n  return (\r\n    <section className=\"login\">\r\n      <div className=\"loginContainer\">\r\n        <label>Username</label>\r\n        <input\r\n          type=\"text\"\r\n          autoFocus\r\n          required\r\n          value={email}\r\n          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\r\n        ></input>\r\n        <p className=\"errorMsg\">{emailError}</p>\r\n        <label>Password</label>\r\n        <input\r\n          type=\"password\"\r\n          required\r\n          value={password}\r\n          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\r\n        ></input>\r\n        <p className=\"errorMsg\">{passwordError}</p>\r\n        <div className=\"btnContainer\">\r\n          {hasAccount ?
